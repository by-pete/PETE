# ref-clients — n0v8v Client Management Procedures

## Client Communication Protocol
- All client comms are executive-level: strategic framing, polished language
- Draft in Robert's voice — direct but professional
- Always tie recommendations to business outcomes (revenue, risk, efficiency)
- Include specific numbers and timelines where possible

## Deliverable Standards
- Monthly strategy reports: 2-3 pages max, executive summary + recommendations
- AI roadmaps: Phased (30/60/90 day), tied to ROI projections
- Meeting prep: Context brief, agenda, anticipated questions, recommended positions

## Client Onboarding Checklist
1. Industry vertical and primary challenges
2. Current tech stack and AI maturity level
3. Decision-making structure (who approves, who blocks)
4. Budget range and ROI expectations
5. Communication preferences (email, Slack, call cadence)
6. Competitive landscape and industry-specific regulations

## Retainer Management
- Track deliverable deadlines per client
- Flag approaching renewals 30 days out
- Monitor satisfaction signals (response times, engagement, scope creep)
- Document key decisions and their rationale for continuity

## IP Boundaries
- n0v8v methodologies are proprietary — never shared with individual clients
- Client-specific data never crosses between clients
- Frameworks can be applied across clients; data cannot
- Bunting operational data is never used in consulting contexts
